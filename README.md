Practicing MERN Stack Development

## What is MERN?

The MERN stack is a popular set of technologies for building full-stack web applications using JavaScript:

- **M - MongoDB**  
  A NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like format (BSON). Ideal for flexible, scalable applications.

- **E - Express.js**  
  A lightweight and flexible Node.js web application framework that simplifies building RESTful APIs and server-side logic.

- **R - React.js**  
  A powerful frontend library for building user interfaces using reusable components. Helps create fast and interactive UIs.

- **N - Node.js**  
  A JavaScript runtime environment that allows running JavaScript on the server side. It enables building scalable and efficient server-side applications.
