## 💡 What is Affiliate Marketing?

Affiliate marketing is a model where individuals (affiliates) earn commissions by promoting a brand’s products or services using unique links.

**Workflow:**
1. Join an affiliate program
2. Get a unique tracking link
3. Share it on blogs, videos, or ads
4. Earn commissions when people buy via your link

> “You promote, someone buys, you earn a cut.”
